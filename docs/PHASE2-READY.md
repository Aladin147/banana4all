# Phase 2 Ready to Start ✅

## Audit Issues Fixed

All Phase 1 audit concerns have been addressed:

### 1. Config Integration ✅
- Imported CONFIG in main.js and photoshop-utils.js
- Replaced all hardcoded values with CONFIG constants
- Using CONFIG.api.defaultProxyUrl, CONFIG.api.proxyHealthTimeout, etc.

### 2. Jest Config Fixed ✅
- Completed truncated jest.config.js file
- All test configurations properly defined

### 3. Manifest Icon Paths Fixed ✅
- Updated from `assets/` to `icons/` directory
- Matches webpack.config.js copy patterns

### 4. Tests Passing ✅
- All 11 tests passing
- No diagnostics in any code files

---

## Phase 2 Spec Complete

### Requirements Document ✅
- 15 comprehensive requirements
- All follow EARS patterns and INCOSE quality rules
- Cover selection detection, inpainting, multi-variant, error handling, and performance

### Design Document ✅
- Clear architecture with 5 main components
- High-level flow diagrams
- Data models and interfaces
- Error handling strategy
- Testing approach
- UI design specifications
- Performance and security considerations

### Tasks Document ✅
- 12 main tasks with detailed sub-tasks
- All tasks required (comprehensive approach)
- 2-week implementation timeline
- Clear requirements mapping
- Implementation order defined

## Phase 2 Spec Location

```
.kiro/specs/phase2-inpainting/
├── requirements.md  (15 requirements)
├── design.md        (Architecture & design)
└── tasks.md         (12 implementation tasks)
```

## How to Start Phase 2 Development

### Option 1: Use Kiro Task Execution
1. Open `.kiro/specs/phase2-inpainting/tasks.md`
2. Click "Start task" next to Task 1
3. Kiro will guide you through implementation

### Option 2: Manual Implementation
1. Follow the task order in tasks.md
2. Start with Task 1: Extend PhotoshopUtils
3. Complete each task before moving to next
4. Test frequently in Photoshop

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1 (Days 1-3): Core Inpainting**
- Extend PhotoshopUtils with selection methods
- Implement inpainting request flow
- Update proxy server for inpainting
- Add layer alignment and feathering

**Week 1 (Days 4-5): UI and Mode Management**
- Add mode detection and UI
- Implement error handling
- Integrate configuration system

**Week 2 (Days 6-7): Multi-Variant**
- Implement multi-variant generation
- Add progress feedback
- Optimize cleanup and resources

**Week 2 (Days 8-10): Polish and Testing**
- Update documentation
- Write comprehensive tests
- Final bug fixes and refinements

---

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Selection-Aware Inpainting**
   - Detect active selections
   - Export selection content and mask
   - Send to API with inpainting mode
   - Place result with pixel-perfect alignment

2. **Auto-Feathering**
   - Apply edge feathering to layer masks
   - Configurable feather radius (default 2px)
   - Seamless blending with original content

3. **Multi-Variant Generation**
   - Generate 1-4 variants per request
   - Organize in layer groups
   - Sequential generation to avoid rate limits
   - Progress feedback during generation

4. **Mode Management**
   - Toggle between "New Layer" and "Edit Selection"
   - Auto-detect selection state
   - Remember user preferences
   - Update UI dynamically

5. **Error Handling**
   - Validate selection size
   - Handle export failures
   - Graceful API error handling
   - Clear user-facing messages

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Selection detection works 100% reliably
- ✅ Inpainted content aligns within 1 pixel
- ✅ Feathering creates seamless blends
- ✅ Multi-variant generates all requested variants
- ✅ Layer groups organize variants correctly
- ✅ Performance: <10s per variant
- ✅ Memory usage: <500MB total
- ✅ UI remains responsive during generation

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- PhotoshopUtils selection methods
- ModeManager state management
- Configuration validation
- Error handling functions

### Integration Tests
- Full inpainting workflow
- Multi-variant generation
- Error scenarios
- Cleanup verification

### Manual Tests
- Various selection tools (marquee, lasso, magic wand)
- Different document sizes
- Edge cases and limits
- Performance under load

---

## Phase 1 Compatibility

Phase 2 is fully backward compatible:
- Phase 1 functionality remains unchanged
- New features are additive
- Users can still use basic text-to-image generation
- Selection mode only activates when selection exists

---

## Ready to Build! 🚀

All audit issues fixed. Complete Phase 2 spec created. You're ready to start implementation.

**Next Step:** Open `.kiro/specs/phase2-inpainting/tasks.md` and start with Task 1.
