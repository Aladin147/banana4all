Banana4All — Research Reference (Nano Banana focus) & Roadmap
Scope

This doc synthesizes what matters from the leading Photoshop integrations of Nano Banana (Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) and frames a phased roadmap to take Banana4All from “can generate inside Photoshop” (your Phase 1) to state-of-the-art and beyond. I’ve trimmed business/pricing—purely tech, UX, and capability.

What Nano Banana is (and why it wins)

Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image a.k.a. Nano Banana—fast, polished, identity-preserving image generation & edits (text-to-image, edit-with-image). All outputs carry SynthID invisible watermarking.

Momentum / placement: Shipping across Google apps and now a partner model inside Photoshop’s Generative Fill (beta), alongside Flux Kontext; users can switch models in-panel. 
TechRadar
+1

Strengths observed: Speed + visual polish; strong subject/identity consistency; good global restyling; less precise than Flux on small, localized, pixel-critical edits and typography.

Safety / disclosure: Visible + invisible watermarking (SynthID) recommended by Google; you should surface this clearly in-plugin.

What leading Photoshop plugins do with Nano Banana (capability checklist)

(Use this as an acceptance test for Banana4All feature parity.)

Selection-aware edits in-place
Generate into current doc as new aligned layers, driven by prompts and current selection/mask—so results are non-destructive and blendable. 
astria.ai

Reference-guided changes
Optional reference image / color pick to steer texture, style, object replacement. (Historically better supported on mac, then improved in UXP panels.) 
astria.ai

Model switching
Within one UI: Nano Banana for speed/identity; Flux Kontext (Pro/Max) for realism/text; some builds also expose a high-res model like Seedream. Your plugin can map this to “Bring-Your-Own-API” backends. 
TechRadar
+1

Upscale / quality pass
One-click upscale for generated layers to overcome base model resolution limits when needed. 
astria.ai

Photoshop-native ergonomics
Lives as a UXP panel / script entry, respects selections/brush workflows, supports shortcut binding. 
Nano Banana Photoshop

Minimal technical architecture (for Banana4All)

UXP Panel (preferred): React-style UI → PS DOM access (selection/masks, active doc, layers). Bridge layer packs selection + context crop(s) to API client. 
TechRadar

API abstraction: One interface supporting OpenRouter / Vertex AI / custom HTTP; normalize: mode (txt2img | img2img | inpaint), images[], masks[], prompt, seed, guidance, safety. 
Google AI for Developers
+1

Job orchestration: Async queue with polling/streaming; timeout + cancel; resumable retries; return binary → new layer, aligned to selection bounds. 
astria.ai

Compliance: If upstream signals SynthID, expose “AI-edited” badge + metadata note in panel. 
Google AI Studio

Phased roadmap to surpass leading plugins

You’re at Phase 1: “generate into Photoshop” ✅
Below, each phase lists Goals, Must-ship, and Engineering notes. Phases are incremental; ship thin slices.

Phase 2 — Pro-grade inpainting & layer hygiene

Goals: Equal baseline quality for local edits; non-destructive stack is clean.
Must-ship

Selection-aware inpaint: Auto-derive a tight content crop (selection bbox + padding), send RGB + binary mask to model; paste result back, auto-feather mask edge. 
astria.ai

Exact alignment: Preserve DPI, transform, and color profile; generated layer is placed under current selection with blend options preset (overlay/normal + opacity). 
astria.ai

One-click Re-roll (N variants): Stacks alternatives in a layer group with thumbnails. 
Nano Banana Photoshop

Engineering

Implement crop tiling for very large selections; stitch with Laplacian seam to avoid borders.

Add seed and determinism toggles if backend supports. 
Google AI for Developers

Phase 3 — Reference-guided edits & prompt ergonomics

Goals: Match the “guided edit” magic.
Must-ship

Reference image input: drag-drop or pick layer as ref; send as images[] alongside mask (style/texture/object). 
blog.google

Foreground color hinting: Read PS foreground color, pass as hint (hex) in prompt. 
astria.ai

Prompt presets: Curated macros (“remove object”, “swap clothing”, “extend background”, “stylize to anime”).
Engineering

Prompt compiler that expands presets to multi-hint prompts (e.g., “preserve subject identity”, “match scene lighting”). Evidence supports NB’s identity retention; codify as default hint. 
Fotor

Phase 4 — Multi-backend & high-res pipeline

Goals: “Bring-your-own-API” done right + print-ready output.
Must-ship

Backend selector: OpenRouter as default; pluggable providers (Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Image, local Comfy/SDXL). 
Google Cloud

Hi-res strategy: 2 paths
a) Native hi-res if provider supports (e.g., 2.5-Flash Image aspect/size). 
Google AI for Developers

b) Two-stage: generate base → upscale (any SR model via API) → optional detail enhance pass. 
astria.ai

Batch/Queue UI: enqueue multiple selections or frames.
Engineering

Memory-safe streaming to disk; show ETA/progress; cancel & partials.

Abstract response schema differences between providers.

Phase 5 — Context fidelity & realism controls

Goals: Close the gap with context-aware edits (Flux-like realism) while staying Nano-first.
Must-ship

Auto-context windows: Along with selection crop, send a downscaled whole-image context to help the model respect global lighting/composition (if backend supports conditioning by multiple images). 
TechRadar

Lighting/consistency toggles: Panel sliders: “conservativeness”, “match lighting/shadows” = prompt weights.

Edge-aware feather & light matching: After paste, run quick shadow/illumination match (curves/levels) on the new layer to blend.
Engineering

Optional second pass: Re-invoke with “make blend seamless” small-radius mask.

Phase 6 — Power-user polish (surpass incumbents)

Goals: Go beyond parity with speed and supervision.
Must-ship

Live preview grid (low-res drafts) before committing; choose 1→ upscale.

Brush-guided generation (“strength map” from brush opacity to steer variability).

History & recipes: Save prompt + seeds + masks per layer; reapply to new images.

Content badges: Surface SynthID present + export note; optional visible badge layer. 
Google AI Studio

Engineering

Caching for identical jobs; LRU of recent assets; async thumbnailer.

UX blueprint (what the best panels get right)

Left: Canvas + standard PS tools. Right: Banana4All panel with: Model selector → Mode (Generate / Edit selection) → Prompt → (Ref image, Color hint) → Seed/Guidance → Buttons: Preview, Generate, Upscale. Results appear as grouped layers with small preview badges and quick actions (Re-roll, Mask soften, Shadow-match).

Developer notes (Gemini / Nano Banana specifics)

API: model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image"; supports image generation and editing; config supports aspect ratio and image inputs for edits. Respect token/image size limits per provider. 
Google AI for Developers

Watermarking: Assume SynthID; expose in UI + docs. 
Google Developers Blog

Photoshop integration: Prefer UXP over legacy ExtendScript for parity on macOS/Windows and better file dialogs/drag-drop. (The public beta shows partner-model toggles inside PS; you’re replicating that ergonomics in a third-party panel.) 
TechRadar

QA / Acceptance tests (per phase)

Identity retention: Replace background, keep subject face constant across 3 re-rolls (rate drift). 
Fotor

Local edit stability: Remove an object; measure SSIM of untouched zones vs. original.

Blend quality: Edge artifact audit at 200% zoom; auto-feather removes halos.

Hi-res pipeline: 300 dpi A3 composite—no tiling seams after upscale.

Latency UX: All API calls cancelable; panel never blocks PS interactions.

Reproducibility: Seeded runs reproduce across machines/backends (within tolerance).

Implementation order (concrete)

Next 7–10 days: Phase 2 core (mask inpaint, alignment, re-rolls, auto-feather).

Following 2–3 weeks: Phase 3 refs + presets; Phase 4 backend abstraction + upscale.

Then: Phase 5 context fidelity; Phase 6 previews/recipes/caching.
